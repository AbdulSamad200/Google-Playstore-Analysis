# Google-Playstore-Analysis
This repository contains code and analysis for exploring the Google Play Store dataset. The dataset provides information about various apps available on the Google Play Store, including details such as app categories, ratings, installs, pricing, and more.
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Google Play Store dataset. We aim to gain insights into various aspects of the app ecosystem, including app categories, ratings, installs, pricing, and more. By analyzing this dataset, we seek to understand trends, patterns, and correlations within the data to provide valuable insights for app developers, marketers, and enthusiasts.

## What We Will Be Doing:
In this analysis, we will perform the following tasks:

**Data Cleaning** : We will clean the dataset by handling missing values, converting data types, and removing unnecessary columns.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We will explore the dataset to understand the distribution of app categories, ratings, installs, pricing, and other relevant features. This will involve visualizing the data using various plots and charts.
**Correlation Analysis**: We will investigate correlations between different variables such as app size, price, and ratings to understand their relationships.
**Trend Analysis**: We will analyze trends over time in app releases, updates, and user ratings to identify patterns and opportunities for developers.
**Revenue Analysis**: We will estimate app revenue by analyzing the number of installs and pricing data, and identify which app categories generate the highest revenue.
**Conclusion and Recommendations**: Based on our analysis findings, we will draw conclusions and provide recommendations for app developers, marketers, and enthusiasts.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this analysis can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps). It contains  (2.3 Million+ App Data).
